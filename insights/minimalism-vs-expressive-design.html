          <p>
            Minimalism communicates restraint. Expressive design communicates energy. The right
            choice depends on brand positioning, category expectations, and audience needs.

            <div class="definition-block">
              <strong>What is expressive design?</strong>
              Expressive design uses bold visual language, dynamic layouts, and emotive elements to
              communicate personality. It is often used to signal creativity or cultural relevance.
            </div>
            <p>
              Minimalism uses restraint, clear hierarchy, and reduced visual noise. Expressive design
              embraces energy, movement, and layered storytelling. Both approaches can be premium when
              executed within a disciplined system.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="minimalism">
            <h2>Minimalist approach</h2>
            <p>
              Minimalism signals focus and sophistication. It reduces cognitive load and creates a
              calm experience, which is particularly effective for luxury, finance, and technology
              brands.
            </p>
            <p>
              The risk of minimalism is uniformity. When every brand adopts the same minimal aesthetic,
              differentiation can weaken. Successful minimalist brands rely on refined typography and
              subtle detailing to maintain distinction.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="expressive">
            <h2>Expressive approach</h2>
            <p>
              Expressive design communicates energy and creativity. It is effective for brands that
              need to signal cultural relevance or bold innovation. However, without clear structure,
              expressive design can feel chaotic and reduce trust.
            </p>
            <p>
              Expressive systems require strong governance: typography rules, color usage, and
              interaction patterns must remain consistent even as visuals evolve.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="selection">
            <h2>Choosing the right path</h2>
            <p>
              The decision should be based on brand positioning, category expectations, and audience
              psychology. A brand architecture studio evaluates where the company needs to stand apart
              and how much visual energy aligns with its promise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many premium brands blend both approaches—using a minimal structure with moments of
              expressive emphasis. This hybrid strategy often delivers clarity without sacrificing
              distinctiveness.
            </p>
