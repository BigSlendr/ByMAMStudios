            Luxury is a design signal before it is a product. This insight unpacks the visual and
            experiential cues that create premium positioning.

            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <div class="definition-block">
              <strong>What is perceived luxury in design?</strong>
              Perceived luxury is the feeling of premium value created through visual restraint,
              quality cues, and intentional experience design. It signals scarcity and elevated
              craftsmanship.
            </div>
            <p>
              Luxury is created by the absence of noise. Premium brands use quiet confidence: refined
              typography, controlled color, and deliberate spacing. The result is a sense of calm
              authority that signals high value.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="signals">
            <h2>Signals of luxury</h2>
            <p>
              Materials, texture, and weight play a role in perceived luxury. In digital environments,
              this translates into subtle gradients, depth, and micro-interactions that feel precise.
            </p>
            <p>
              High-quality imagery, generous whitespace, and consistent visual rhythm reinforce the
              idea that the brand is selective. Visual density is intentionally limited to avoid
              commodity signals.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="scarcity">
            <h2>Scarcity &amp; pacing</h2>
            <p>
              Scarcity is communicated through pacing. Premium brands avoid overwhelming audiences
              with information; instead, they deliver messages in curated sequences. This slower pace
              signals confidence and creates a sense of exclusivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scarcity language also matters. Terms like “select clients” and “partnership” reinforce
              the idea that access is limited, enhancing perceived value.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="experience">
            <h2>Experience alignment</h2>
            <p>
              Luxury signals must be supported by the experience itself. Fast performance, clear
              navigation, and polished interactions ensure the promise is credible. A premium brand
              with a chaotic experience loses trust immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              When design systems support luxury cues consistently, the brand feels intentional and
              elevated across every channel.
            </p>
